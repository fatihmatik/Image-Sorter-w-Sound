What does it do?
  Shuffles the given image to the input split count and rearranges and creates video file with a sorting algorithm audio.
  
How it works and how to make it work:
  Takes the "ex.png" in the directory of the scripts and splits them by the input number.
  Shuffles the split images, then step by step rearranges them and creates a image frame.
  Whilst creating the image frames, creates a frequency based on the index number it is sorting.
  The sorting of the dissolved image is done by the Bubble Sort algorithm.
  At the end the script merges the sound and the frames together to create a video.

  To run the script you just have to open the main.py from the CLI and enter the number of splits you'd like and desired miliseconds for every image frame.

the idea came from "sorting trollface algorithm" from Youtube.
